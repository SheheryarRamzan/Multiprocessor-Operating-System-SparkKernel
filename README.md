# Multiprocessor-Operating-System-SparkKernel
Implemented a simple Multithreaded kernel “SparkKernel” with a scheduler. This kernel would be able to run simulated processes and threads.

SparkKernel is a simple yet powerful multithreaded kernel, equipped with a scheduler, designed to simulate processes and threads efficiently. This innovative kernel enables concurrent execution of tasks, optimizing system performance and resource utilization.

Key Features:

Multithreaded Execution: SparkKernel empowers parallel execution of tasks, allowing multiple threads to run concurrently, enhancing the overall system responsiveness.

Task Scheduling: The built-in scheduler efficiently manages task allocation, ensuring fair distribution of computing resources and minimizing processing bottlenecks.

Process and Thread Simulation: SparkKernel creates a simulated environment for processes and threads, enabling developers to evaluate system behavior and performance without affecting the actual hardware.

Resource Optimization: By utilizing multithreading capabilities, SparkKernel maximizes CPU utilization, reducing idle time and improving system efficiency.

Thread Synchronization: The kernel includes synchronization mechanisms, such as semaphores and mutexes, to prevent data races and ensure thread safety.
